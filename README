Instructions on running the tests, explanation of the directory structures,
list of configuration parameters, snapshots of performance and validation
results of some CAF compilers (UHCAF, Cray, Intel, and G95) are all located
under:

<performance|validation>/docs/README_<PERFORMANCE|VALIDATION>

 Using CAF Validation and Performance Test Suites

If the tests are executed from this root directory of the test suite, then
USAGE: make <performance | validation | clean> PARAMS=<OPTIONS>

---------OPTIONS for VALIDATION TEST SUITE-------------

If test suite is run from within validation directory, then USAGE: make OPTIONS 
 OPTIONS include:
 |  (Note: <suite> = fewtests | feature | crosschecked_feature | status )
 |                            
 |_ all:                      all validation tests                                                                      
 |_ fewtests:                 tests only those listed in the file test_file under ./few directory                       
 |_ feature:                  tests the compiler's feature support (excludes tests that include verification)           
 |_ crosschecked_feature:     performs cross-testing to test support for non-determinism handling constructs            
 |_ status:                   tests for verifying handling of status returned by certain statements                     
 |_ clean<suite>:             Cleans executables                                                                        
 |_ cleanall:                 Cleans everything - results, tests-history, compiler-logs, runtime-logs                   

Before running the tests, ensure that the CONFIG file with the required parameters are set in validation/config directory.

---------OPTIONS for PERFORMANCE TEST SUITE-------------

If test suite is run from within performance directory, then USAGE: make [OPTIONS [COMPILER=uhcaf(default)|ifort|g95|crayftn] ]
OPTIONS include:
| ( Note: <suite>: [kernels | microbenchmarks | npb | all] )
|                                                                                                                  
|_ compile_<suite>:      compiles and generates logs for the codes                                                 
|_ execute_<suite>:      executes and generates logs for the codes                                                 
|_ complete_<suite>:     executes and generates logs for the codes                                                 
|_ clean<suite>:         cleans up the logs, executables and all previous history of the regression runs           

Before running any <suite>, please ensure that:
 The 'user-defined' parameters are set in support/CONFIG 
 The compiler specific parameters in support/CONFIG-compiler.<compiler> 

There is no need to set the make.def* within  support/CONFIG. They are auto-generated by the Makefiles.
Before running any kernel tests, please ensure that the number of images(NPROCS) for every kernel is set in the *.def file 
within its directory. E.g. mm.def within kernels/src/mm sets the number of images to run the Matrix multiplication code
