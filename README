=============================================================================

Instructions on running the tests, explanation of the directory structures,
list of configuration parameters, snapshots of performance and validation
results of some CAF compilers (UHCAF, Cray, Intel, and G95) are all located
under:

<performance|validation>/docs/README_<PERFORMANCE|VALIDATION>

If the tests are executed from this parent directory of the test suite, then

USAGE: make <performance | validation | clean> PARAMS=<OPTIONS>

-------------------- OPTIONS for VALIDATION TEST SUITE -----------------------

If test suite is run from within validation directory, then

USAGE: make OPTIONS 

 OPTIONS include:
 |  (Note: <suite> = fewtests | feature | confidence | fault )
 |                  
 |_ all:            tests for conformance, fault-tolerance and confidence tests                               
 |_ fewtests:       tests only those listed in the file test_file under ./few directory                       
 |_ feature:        tests the compiler's feature support (excludes tests that include verification)           
 |_ confidence:     performs cross-testing to test support for non-determinism handling constructs            
 |_ fault:          tests for verification of fault handling constructs                                       
 |_ clean<suite>:   Cleans executables                                                                        
 |_ cleanall:       Cleans everything - results, tests-history, compiler-logs, runtime-logs                   

Before running the tests, ensure that the CONFIG file with the required
parameters are set in validation/config directory.

-------------------- OPTIONS for PERFORMANCE TEST SUITE --------------------

If test suite is run from within performance directory, then

USAGE: make [OPTIONS [COMPILER=uhcaf(default)|ifort|g95] ]

OPTIONS include:
| ( Note: <suite>: [kernels | microbenchmarks | npb | all] )
|                                                                                                                  
|_ compile_<suite>:      compiles and generates logs for the codes                                                 
|_ run_<suite>:          executes and generates logs for the codes                                                 
|_ complete_<suite>:     executes and generates logs for the codes                                                 
|_ clean<suite>:         cleans up the logs, executables and all previous history of the regression runs           

Before running the Performance tests, please ensure:
- The test_suite specific parameters are set in /../support/CONFIG 
- The compiler specific parameters in /../support/CONFIG-compiler.<compiler> 

The number of images may be varied for each test-category from the
corresponding test_*.sh script
