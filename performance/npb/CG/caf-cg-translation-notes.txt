cg.working1.f: 
   sum reductions done explicitly with recursive doubling, using PUT
   sum variable is not a coarray
   sync alls optimized 
  
cg.working2.f:
   sum reductions done using co_sum intrinsic 
   sum variable is a coarray
   optimized local computation with non-coarray sum1 variable

cg.working3.f:
   sum reductions done explicitly with recursive doubling, using PUT
   sum variable is not a coarray
   sync all NOT opimized

cg.working4.f:
   same as cg.working.f with commented out MPI communication.
   sum reductions done using co_sum intrinsic 
   sum variable is a coarray
   optimized local computation with non-coarray sum1 variable
