NAS Parallel Benchmarks
-----------------------

The NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) are a small set of programs designed to help
evaluate the performance of parallel supercomputers. The benchmarks, which are
derived from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications, consist of five
kernels and three pseudo-applications. The NPB come in several "flavors." NAS
solicits performance results for each from all sources.
