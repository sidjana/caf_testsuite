The performance suite comes bundled along with the validation test suite. The performance suite is located under: 

PERFORMANCE\_PATH = /caf\_testsuite/performance/

The installation requires the setup of a few configuration parameters. These parameters can be divided into two types:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generic parameters: These are testsuite specific parameters which can be used to specify the location of the compilation, execution result-dumps. These are located in \$PERFORMANCE\_PATH/support/CONFIG
\item Compiler-specific: These are compiler dependent parameters and can be used to adjust the compiler/execution commands, flags and launcher options. These are located in \$PEFORMANCE\_PATH/support/CONFIG-compiler.<compiler>
\end{enumerate}

The configuration parameters are enlisted under section \ref{sec:config}.

\subsubsection{Configuration params}
\input{config}

\subsubsection{Running the tests}
For running the tests:
\begin{enumerate}
\item cd \$PERFORMANCE\_PATH
\item make [OPTIONS] [COMPILER=uhcaf|ifort|g95] ...
 Where, OPTIONS include:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item <suite>:          [kernels|microbenchmarks|npb|all]
 \item compile\_<suite>: compiles and generates logs for the codes
 \item run\_<suite>:     executes and generates logs for the codes
 \item complete\_<suite>:executes and generates logs for the codes
 \item clean\_<suite>:   cleans up the logs, executables and all previous history of the regression runs
 \item help:             displays this message
 \item cleanall:         cleans up the entire performance test suite
 \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
