This section outlines the different categories of tests within the suite that can be used to evaluate the performance of binaries generated by a CAF compiler
implementation. 

In this report, ROOT = <parent\_directory of caf\_testsuite> and \$PEFORMANCE\_PATH=<\$ROOT/performance>

There are three main categories of tests in the test suite. Each category is located in a different subdirectory within \$PEFORMANCE\_PATH, and all the tests within the same category can be executed using either the single Makefile in \$PEFORMANCE\_PATH or individual Maefiles within the corresponding subdirectories. 

\subsubsection{Kernels}
These includes some standalone CAF applications. The list includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item CG (2D)
\item Buffon Laplace
\item Image Smoothing
\item Insertion sort
\item Insertion sort (D-type)
\item Matrix Multiplication
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Microbenchmarks}
These includes simple CAF codes with point to point communications. The list of test includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item bidirectional
\item get\_bandwidth
\item noncontiguous
\item ping\_pong    
\item put\_latency
\item broadcast
\item get\_latency
\item partial\_data
\item put\_bandwidth
\item Reductions using remote 'get' ops 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{NPB}
These include the CAF version of the NAS 3.3.1 The current tests include EP, CG, SP, BT. The EP and CG have been developed at the University of Houston. The SP and BT have been developed by the NAS team @ NASA.
